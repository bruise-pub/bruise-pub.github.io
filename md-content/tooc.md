# TOOC

A Tiny Open Online Course built to explore digital and experimental publishing practices and theory.

The development of this has been greatly informed by the work of the [Pirate Care Syllabus](https://syllabus.pirate.care/).

## howto

I'm assembling this here, gradually.  
The outline should emerge below.  

## overview

Specifically considering the interplay of texts encountered through a singular device.  

>The digital text manifests palimpsest.

>How is writing shaped by the screen?

## modules

Libraries
- Adhoc, Caring, Digitising

Screens
- E-readers, E-ink

Readers
- Reader/Writer, User

## course dates

live, open

I'm intending to follow these modules starting Autumn 2021.

I'm open to suggestions of how a cohort can move through this together.  
Shared etherpad docs?  
Shared Git repo?  
A gemini capsule?

Please email me if you'd like to discuss this at ghostglyph@gmail.com
