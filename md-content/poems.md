# Poems

This epub contains a collection of poems. By downloading this epub via Itch you should automatically be notified of any updates. I intend to continue adding poems to this edition and perhaps editing earlier ones.

It's all loose and as likely to change as it is to be forgotten.

The poems are often written as part of ideas for Dead Hand projects or diversions from whatever text I'm working on.

[Poems Collected](https://ghostglyph.itch.io/poems-collected)

The current version is published as v0.9.

An annotated version will be uploaded soon (November 2021) which was created for inclusion in the [Two Queens members show](https://2queens.com/exhibitions/two-queens-members-show-2021). I used the drawing tool I made ( [Flat Sketch](https://ghostglyph.itch.io/flat-sketch) ) to draw on the pages, marking them with doodles and words from an imagined protest.
