# Locality

A loose trilogy of novels taking place in fictional apparitions of Leicester, UK and Nice, France.

They are about places and the way communities are formed, the way individuals enter new places, build community and observe being and belonging.

They each have a degree of paranoiac experience, which increases in each subsequent book.

None of them have endings that resolve. The characters are left within the spaces.
