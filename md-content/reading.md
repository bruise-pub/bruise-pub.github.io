In the last year or so I've been taking much more time, enjoyment and care over reading than I had for a long time.

It's probably this kind of reading that most informs the directions I write in, so it feels like it makes sense to share it.

I read on a bunch of different screens, and am actively seeking a open source e-reader solution; like [The Open Book Project](https://github.com/joeycastillo/The-Open-Book).

I keep my library organised and convert, edit and build books within [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/).
